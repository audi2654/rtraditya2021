How to run OpenGL XWindows on WSL2 in Windows 10

1. Install the latest WSL2 on Windows 10 with Ubuntu 20 or 22

2. Install Desktop Environment & Mesa Library & Driver for Intel machines on WSL2
   a) use cmd: sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop mesa-utils

3. Install VcXsrv XServer on Windows for actually viewing the GUI XWindow on Windows
   a) use exe installer: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/

   b) Open VcXsrv XLaunch from Start Menu
   	i. Select Display Settings: Multiple Windows
	ii. Display Number: 0
	Click Next
	iii. Select how to start client: Start no client
	Click Next
	iv. Extra Settings - Check boxes for all, especially Disable access control
	v. Finish

   c)Verify VcXsrv is running in Notification Tray at Windows Taskbar

4. Get the IPv4 Address of you machine (Use ipconfig or WiFi properties)

4. Open WSL2 Instance
   a) run cmd: export DISPLAY=IPv4 Address:0.0
   b) glxgears to test th working of OpenGL


NOTES
1. In WSL2 if file at cmd: cat /etc/resolv.conf shows 'nameserver 192.168.X.X' i.e some different IP 
	then everytime when you use OpenGL in WSL2 after running VcXsrv, always do step-4.a & 4.boxes

	-In WSL you may require to change .bashrc file to always avoid doing above
		In WSL edit ~/.bashrc & put:
			export DISPLAY=IPv4 Address:0.0
			unset LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT or LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0 
		     OR set LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT or LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1

    -If 'cat /etc/resolv.conf' shows your correct IPv4 Address, you can avoid doing above everytime by 
	cmd: export DISPLAY=$(grep -m 1 nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0
	OR cmd: export DISPLAY="$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed 's/nameserver //'):0"

2. Optional - If 'export DISPLAY' doesn't work, add Firewall Rule for XServer
	Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings > 
	Inbound Rules > New Rule... > Program > %ProgramFiles%\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe > 
	Allow the connection > checked Domain/Private/Public > Named and Confirmed Rule

3. Optional - Set variable for Direct or Indirect Rendering, whichever works
	-For Direct: export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0	(supports OpenGL any version supported by drivers v4.x)
	-For Indirect: export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1	(supports only up to OpenGL v1.4)
